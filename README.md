### Keymap

If you have already used these shortcuts, please try to set shortcuts to keymap (Tools > Options).

## Custom fuel directory name

If you use "myfuel" name instead of "fuel" directory name, please set as the following.

1. Project properties > Framework > FuelPHP
2. fuel name : your fuel directoy name (e.g. myfuel)

### Notice
You can change only the fuel directory name. Many features don't work if other directory names are changed.

## View path code completion
Plugin provides support for view path code completion.
e.g.

```php
View::forge('[Ctrl+Space]');
View::forge('welcome/[Ctrl+Space]');
ViewModel::forge('[Ctrl+Space]');
// popup directory and file names
```
If you push enter key at the directory name, please, run [Ctrl+Space] again. And directory childrenis displayed on popup list.

## MVC and modules Nodes
Create MVC(model, views, controller) and modules nodes on the project pane.
```
myproject
├─source files
├─test files
├─important files
├─include path
├─controller (fuel/app/classes/controller)
├─model (fuel/app/classes/model)
├─views (fuel/app/views)
├─modules (fuel/app/modules)

```

If you would like to hide the MVC directories in the source files,
please move to `Project properties > Framework > FuelPHP` and check "ignore..."

If you check "ignore...",
active position isn't moved to the source files node when you create a new file at the MVC nodes.
Otherwise go to there.

**Please notice that if you use remote upload on save, you can't ignore these.**

## PHPUnit Test Init Action
Project right-click > FuelPHP > PHPUnit Test Init

This action will create the necessary files to run PHPUnit in NetBeans.
And set them.

## Create Test Action
You can create Test Case files from context menu on file nodes or editor.

## Hyperlink Navigation
This feature is similar to Go To action.

1. Hold-down Ctrl key
2. wait until text color is changed to blue
3. click
4. go to file

e.g.
```php
// move cursor on 'bootstrap.css'
// 1. ... 4.
Asset::css('bootstrap.css');
```
